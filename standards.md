# Code Standards

> This file contains coding standards for the project.
> Stack-specific conventions will be added by `/wf-generate`.

## General

- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Write tests for new functionality
- Keep functions focused and small
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Document non-obvious decisions

## Commits

Use conventional commits: `type(scope): description`

**Types**:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code restructuring
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `test`: Adding/updating tests
- `chore`: Build, config, dependencies
- `style`: Formatting, whitespace

**Examples**:
```
feat(auth): add password reset flow
fix(api): handle null response from external service
refactor(users): extract validation logic
```
